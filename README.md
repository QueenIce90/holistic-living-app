# holistic-living-app

Project Concept: Holistic Living Hub with Chakra Healing and Calendar
Backend (Flask and SQLAlchemy):
Models:

User
Crystal
Practice (for meditation and yoga practices)
DietPlan (for alkaline diet plans)
Chakra (for Chakra Healing)
Event (for scheduling meditation and yoga sessions)
Relationships:

Many-to-Many relationship between User and Crystal (users can have multiple crystals, and a crystal can be associated with multiple users).
Many-to-Many relationship between User and Practice (users can have multiple meditation and yoga practices, and a practice can be associated with multiple users).
Many-to-Many relationship between User and DietPlan (users can have multiple diet plans, and a diet plan can be associated with multiple users).
Many-to-Many relationship between User and Chakra (users can have multiple chakras, and a chakra can be associated with multiple users).
One-to-Many relationship between User and Event (users can schedule multiple events, and an event is associated with one user).
RESTful Routes:

Users, Crystals, Practices, DietPlans, Chakras (similar CRUD routes).
Events (CRUD routes)
Validation and Error Handling:

Implement validation for creating and updating models.
Handle errors gracefully with appropriate error messages.
Something New:

Implement a feature that allows users to schedule and manage events (meditation sessions and yoga practices) on their personalized calendar.
Frontend (React with React Router, useContext or Redux):
Client-Side Routes (React Router):

/home - Homepage with an overview of the holistic living hub.
/crystals - Page for exploring and adding crystals.
/practices - Page for meditation and yoga practices.
/diet - Page for starting an alkaline diet.
/chakras - Page for Chakra Healing assessments and recommendations.
/calendar - Personalized calendar for scheduling and tracking events.
/journal - Feature to track and journal spiritual experiences.
CRUD Actions:

Implement forms and components for creating, updating, and deleting crystals, practices, diet plans, chakras, and events.
Calendar Feature:

Integrate a calendar library (e.g., FullCalendar or react-big-calendar) for an interactive and visually appealing calendar interface.
Allow users to add, edit, and delete events directly from the calendar.
Something New:

Enhance the calendar feature with reminders, notifications, and the ability to set goals for meditation and yoga practices.
Context or Redux:

Use React context or Redux for state management, especially for managing user-related data and interactions.
Additional Considerations:
User Authentication:

Implement user authentication to personalize the experience and allow users to save their preferences.
Search Feature:

Implement a search feature for crystals, practices, diet plans, chakras, and events.
Educational Content:

Include educational content on effective scheduling, goal setting, and the benefits of consistent meditation and yoga practices.
Community Forum:

Implement a community forum where users can share their calendar-related experiences and tips.
Responsive Design:

Ensure the website is responsive and accessible across different devices.
Testing:

Implement unit tests for critical frontend and backend functionalities.
Deployment:

Deploy the application to a cloud platform for public access.
